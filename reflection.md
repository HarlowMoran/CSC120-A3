1. I consulted with Eva and Milika for this assignment. 
2. 
3. I am in an unusual situation where I have only ever coded in Java. So while on the last assignment I felt like I was scrabling to understnd syntax, this  assignment felt a lot easier because all I had to worry about was fufilling the actual assignment, rather than figuring out the language simultaneously with the assignment.
4. It seems like the general structure in the same between the two langauges. For example, classes and methods seem fairly similar.
5. I was very thankful to have remebered the use of Scanner. I didn't really understand how to alter the responses, though, looking for keywords.
