1. I consulted with Eva and Milika for this assignment. I also worked with Gemma when we were in TA hours together.
2. I attended 7-9pm office hours and recieved help from a tutor named Ashley. (Through revising this assignment I attended many more TA hours, where I worked with several other TAs, although I did not record all of their names.)
3. I am in an unusual situation where I have only ever coded in Java. So while on the last assignment I felt like I was scrabling to understnd syntax, this  assignment felt a lot easier because all I had to worry about was fufilling the actual assignment, rather than figuring out the language simultaneously with the assignment. (As I went to revise this assignment, I learn a lot more syntax, and struggled with the depth of the assignment beyond the amount of Java I already knew.)
4. It seems like the general structure in the same between the two langauges. For example, classes and methods seem fairly similar.
5. I was very thankful to have remebered the use of Scanner. I didn't really understand how to alter the responses, though, looking for keywords. However going to tutoring/TA hours was incredibly helpful, and the tutor taught me how to use mirrorWords().
